# Per-Capita-Income-
This project implements Simple Linear Regression to study the relationship between year and per capita income using historical data. The objective is to understand how income changes over time and to predict future values based on the learned linear trend. The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and prediction. Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are used for efficient computation and visualization. The regression line is visualized along with actual data points to evaluate model performance. This project provides a clear and beginner-friendly introduction to supervised learning concepts.
